## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Roadmap (Based on Briefs)

### Priority 1: Relay Control Logic âœ“ COMPLETED
1. **Relay Control Based on Alarm Priority and State** âœ“
   - Implemented notification scenarios:
     - Relay1 (Siren): ON for ANY active alarm (any priority), OFF when all acknowledged
     - CRITICAL: Siren ON + Beacon ON (constant) â†’ Acknowledged: Beacon ON (constant)
     - HIGH: Siren ON + Beacon ON (constant) â†’ Acknowledged: Beacon ON (blink 2s on/30s off)
     - MEDIUM: Siren ON + Beacon ON (blink 2s on/30s off) â†’ Acknowledged: Beacon OFF
     - LOW: Siren ON + No beacon action
   - Handles multiple active alarms (uses highest priority for beacon)

2. **Relay Control via Modbus RTU** âœ“
   - Implemented registers 860-862 handling
   - Modes: 0=Auto, 1=Force Off, 2=Force On
   - Relay 3 controlled via Modbus only
   - Status feedback in registers 11-13

### Priority 2: Display & LED Improvements âœ“ COMPLETED
1. **Circular Text Scrolling** âœ“
   - Implemented smooth pixel-based scrolling without jumping
   - Configurable speed via SCROLL_SPEED_PIXELS and SCROLL_UPDATE_DELAY_MS
   - Fixed UTF-8 support for Cyrillic characters

2. **Multiple Unacknowledged Alarms** âœ“
   - Implemented 3-line alarm display format
   - Line 1: Priority (C/H/M/L) + alarm type
   - Line 2: Point name + temperature/status (with ACK suffix for acknowledged)
   - Line 3: Alarm counter (e.g., "1/3") + activation time (HH:MM)
   - Manual advancement through alarms with button press

3. **System Status Mode** âœ“
   - Enter/Exit: Long button press (>3s)
   - Navigate pages: Short button press
   - Auto-exit: 30s timeout
   - Pages:
     1. Network info (IP, WiFi status)
     2. System stats (Points configured, Active sensors, Unbound sensors count)
     3. Alarm summary by priority
     4. Alarm summary by type
     5. Modbus status

4. **LED Indicators** âœ“
   - Fixed LED logic per requirements
   - GREEN: ON when no alarms (system OK)
   - RED: Solid for CRITICAL priority
   - YELLOW: Solid for HIGH priority
   - BLUE: Solid for MEDIUM, Blinking for LOW priority

### Priority 3: Core Functionality Completion
1. **Acknowledged Alarm Re-activation Delays** âœ“
   - Configurable per priority via ConfigAssist
   - Timer starts on acknowledgment
   - Re-activate if condition persists after delay

2. **Sensor Disconnection Behavior** âœ“ COMPLETED

   - Keep sensor error alarm active
   - Prevent false temperature alarms (TEMPORARY)
   - Implemented: Temperature alarms auto-resolve when sensor error is active

3. **Alarm State Transitions** âœ“ COMPLETED
   - Extend current working transitions (don't rewrite)
   - Ensure proper state persistence

   - make all the html pages look the same style âœ“
   - do not change any JS logic or section layout, just appearence. âœ“
   - Implemented: Created common.css with all shared styles
   - Added CSS file handler to ConfigManager.cpp to serve common.css
   - Updated all 8 HTML files to use common.css
   - Removed duplicate inline styles from HTML files

1. **Temperature Trend Charts** âœ“ COMPLETED
   - Modal implementation (click trend icon in dashboard) âœ“

## Implementation Notes
1. Always maintain backwards compatibility during migration
2. Use Doxygen documentation for all new code
3. Follow existing code conventions and patterns
4. Test on actual hardware before major releases
5. Keep web interface modular with separate HTML/CSS/JS
6. Implement proper error handling and recovery
