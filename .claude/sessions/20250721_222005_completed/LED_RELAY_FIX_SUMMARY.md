# LED and Relay Fix Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed LED Logic According to Requirements
- **GREEN LED**: Now turns ON when no alarms present (system OK)
- **RED LED**: Solid ON for CRITICAL priority alarms only
- **YELLOW LED**: Solid ON for HIGH priority alarms (removed incorrect blinking)
- **BLUE LED**: Solid ON for MEDIUM priority, Blinking (200ms/2000ms) for LOW priority

### 2. Implemented Smart Blinking State Management
- Added state tracking to prevent unnecessary blinking restarts
- Only starts/stops blinking when alarm state actually changes
- Tracks previous blinking parameters to avoid redundant calls
- This fixes the "blinking restart cycles" issue

### 3. Code Changes
- Modified `handleAlarmOutputs()` in TemperatureController.cpp
- Added `_greenLedState` member variable to track green LED state
- Removed YellowLED blinking for medium priority (was incorrect)
- Fixed BlueLED to be solid for medium, blinking for low priority
- Added comprehensive Doxygen documentation

### 4. Technical Details
- Relay2 blinking timing remains: 2s on / 30s off
- BlueLED blinking for low priority: 200ms on / 2000ms off (short flash)
- State variables track: relay2WasBlinking, blueLedWasBlinking
- Parameter tracking prevents redundant startBlinking calls

## Testing Required
1. Verify GREEN LED is ON when no alarms
2. Test each alarm priority shows correct LED pattern
3. Confirm blinking doesn't restart unnecessarily
4. Check relay operation matches specification

## Relay1 Fix (Additional Change)

### Issue
- Relay1 was only activating for CRITICAL priority alarms
- User requested it should activate for ANY active alarm of ANY priority
- This was the original behavior that needed to be restored

### Solution
Modified `handleAlarmOutputs()` in TemperatureController.cpp:
```cpp
// Changed from:
bool relay1State = false;  // Then only set true for critical

// To:
bool relay1State = (criticalActive + highActive + mediumActive + lowActive) > 0;
```

### Result
- Relay1 (siren) now activates when ANY alarm is in ACTIVE stage
- Works for all priorities: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- Turns off only when ALL active alarms have been acknowledged
- Properly alerts operators to any new alarms needing attention
