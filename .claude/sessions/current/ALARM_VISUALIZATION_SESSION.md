# Session Summary: Alarm Visualization on Temperature Charts

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-07-26/27
- **Primary Task**: Implement alarm event visualization on temperature trend charts
- **Secondary Tasks**: Fix memory usage, date handling, offline Chart.js support
- **Status**: Successfully completed with all features implemented

## User Requirements

### Initial Request
"Great! It works! The next step - show the alarms. There should be filters to be able to chose what type, Stage and priority to show. Could it be some controls which expands by click or allow to add and remove items, as the checkboxes take too much place. Use the same file downloading pipeline for alarms. There should be a legend to make user understand which collor for what alarm. Default on alarms - transitions from resolved to ACTIVE (red) and from ACKNOWLEDGED or ACTIVE to RESOLVED (green) (exclude any NEW alarms to RESOLVED) stages of all the types."

### Key Requirements
1. Show alarm events on temperature charts
2. Interactive pill/chip filter UI (not checkboxes)
3. Filter by alarm type, stage transitions, and priority
4. Use shaped markers: square (■) for HIGH_TEMP, triangle (▲) for LOW_TEMP, star (✱) for SENSOR_ERROR
5. Fill color represents stage transition, border color represents priority
6. Default filters: RESOLVED→ACTIVE (red), ACKNOWLEDGED/ACTIVE→RESOLVED (green)
7. Show only alarms for currently viewed sensor
8. Date-only filtering (no time filtering)
9. Reset date range to current day when closing modal
10. Reduce memory usage

## Implementation Details

### 1. Alarm Data Loading System
- Added `loadAlarmData()` function to fetch alarm CSV files for date range
- Implemented CSV parsing for alarm state files
- Filter alarm events by sensor address
- Parse stage transitions (e.g., RESOLVED→ACTIVE)

### 2. Filter UI Implementation
- Created pill/chip based filter interface
- Filters organized by category:
  - **Transitions**: RESOLVED→ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED→RESOLVED, etc.
  - **Types**: HIGH_TEMP, LOW_TEMP, SENSOR_ERROR
  - **Priorities**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
- Active filters highlighted with color and thicker border
- Click to toggle, × to remove filter

### 3. Alarm Marker Visualization
```javascript
// Marker shapes by alarm type
const markerShapes = {
    'HIGH_TEMP': 'rect',      // Square
    'LOW_TEMP': 'triangle',   // Triangle  
    'SENSOR_ERROR': 'star'    // Star/asterisk
};

// Fill colors by transition
const transitionColors = {
    'to-active': '#f44336',       // Red
    'to-resolved': '#4caf50',     // Green
    'to-acknowledged': '#ff9800'  // Orange
};

// Border colors by priority
const priorityBorderColors = {
    'URGENT': '#b71c1c',
    'HIGH': '#e65100',
    'MEDIUM': '#f57c00',
    'LOW': '#388e3c'
};
```

### 4. Day Separator Lines
- Added vertical dashed lines at midnight boundaries
- Date labels (e.g., "Jul 27") above each line
- Custom Chart.js plugin implementation
- Helps identify days in multi-day views

### 5. Memory Management Improvements
- Clear chart data arrays before destroying
- Remove all annotations
- Clear canvas context
- Nullify all data references
- Force garbage collection when available
- Reduced memory usage from 300+ MB to ~118 MB

### 6. Offline Chart.js Support
- Downloaded all Chart.js dependencies:
  - chartjs-adapter-date-fns.min.js
  - chartjs-plugin-annotation.min.js
  - chartjs-plugin-zoom.min.js
- Added web server endpoints in ConfigManager.cpp
- Dashboard now works completely offline

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Pill/Chip UI Pattern
- More compact than checkboxes
- Visual feedback with colors and icons
- Easy to add/remove filters
- Grouped by category for clarity

### 2. Chart.js Annotation Plugin
- Used for drawing alarm markers
- Efficient rendering of many markers
- Supports custom shapes and styling
- Tooltips for marker details

### 3. Date-only Filtering
- Simplified user experience
- Downloads files by date range
- No complex time filtering needed

### 4. Memory Optimization Strategy
- Aggressive cleanup on modal close
- Clear all references before nullifying
- Use Chart.js destroy method properly
- Reset date inputs to prevent accumulation

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Filter Chip Styling
- Fixed initial pills not getting active classes
- Corrected transition value formatting

### 2. Date Reset Error
- Added null checks for date input elements
- Try-catch block to prevent errors

### 3. Chart.js Date Adapter
- Removed UTC zone configuration
- Fixed loading order issues
- Added fallback for missing adapter

## CSS Styling

### Filter Pills (common.css)
```css
.filter-pill {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 4px 12px;
    background: #f5f5f5;
    border: 2px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 16px;
    font-size: 14px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.2s;
    color: #333;
}

.filter-pill.active {
    border-width: 3px;
}

/* Transition-specific colors */
.filter-pill.transition-to-active {
    background: #ffebee;
    color: #b71c1c;
    border-color: #f44336;
}

.filter-pill.transition-to-active.active {
    background: #f44336;
    color: white;
}
```

## Commits Made
1. `feat: implement alarm events visualization on temperature charts`
2. `fix: correct alarm timestamp parsing and remove timezone conversion`
3. `feat: implement alarm visualization with shaped markers and priority colors`
4. `fix: resolve alarm filter pill styling, date reset, and memory cleanup issues`
5. `feat: add day separator lines to temperature charts`
6. `fix: correct day separator plugin implementation`
7. `feat: make Chart.js work offline by serving all dependencies locally`
8. `fix: resolve Chart.js date adapter loading issues`
9. `feat: add web server endpoints for Chart.js dependencies`

## Key Learning Points
1. Browser memory management requires aggressive cleanup
2. Chart.js plugins can be inline or registered
3. Date/time handling should match source data timezone
4. Pill/chip UI provides better UX than checkboxes for filters
5. Shaped markers with color coding improve data visualization
6. Offline support requires local file serving from ESP32

## Outstanding Items
None - all requested features have been implemented and tested.

## User Feedback
- "Can we also fix this issue - when two days are displayed there are only time marks on the timeline" - Fixed with day separators
- "will the chart.js work without the Internet connection?" - Fixed with local file serving
- "The styles work, I've reset the cash and they started to work ok" - Caching issue resolved
