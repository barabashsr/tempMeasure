## Session: 2025-07-23 - Screen Timeout and Alarm Display Improvements
### Task: Implement screen timeout and fix alarm display issues
### Status: Completed

### Initial Issues Reported:
1. Screen timeout was working but alarms weren't activating or showing
2. Long press wasn't switching to alarm sections
3. Acknowledged alarms weren't cycling
4. Duplicate alarms showing (1/4 instead of 1/2)

### Investigation Results:
- Found alarm checking code was commented out in updateAlarms()
- SECTION_ACK_ALARMS was calling wrong display function
- _hasAlarmForPoint was checking isActive() preventing duplicate detection
- Network display was too verbose with headers

### Implementation Progress:

#### Phase 1: Fixed Alarm Activation
- Uncommented critical alarm checking code in updateAlarms()
- Added alarm pre-creation for all measurement points at startup
- Fixed _hasAlarmForPoint to not check isActive() status

#### Phase 2: Simplified Network Display
- Removed verbose headers (STATUS:, IP:, SSID:)
- Made network connection screen more compact

#### Phase 3: Implemented Screen Timeout
- Added SCREEN_TIMEOUT_MS (10 seconds) #define
- Added ALARM_DISPLAY_TIME_MS (5 seconds) #define
- Implemented screen wake on button press
- Screen stays on when alarms present
- Added _screenOff flag and _lastActivityTime tracking

#### Phase 4: Fixed Acknowledged Alarms Cycling
- Fixed double-increment issue in button handler
- Button press now properly cycles through acknowledged alarms
- Removed redundant index increment in SECTION_ACK_ALARMS handler

### Key Technical Details:
1. **Alarm Timestamp Behavior:**
   - Shows alarm activation time (not acknowledgment time)
   - Persists during reactivation after acknowledge delay
   - Resets only when alarm is resolved and re-triggered

2. **Screen Timeout Logic:**
   - Only applies to NORMAL and STATUS sections
   - No timeout when any alarms present (active or acknowledged)
   - Button press wakes screen without performing action

3. **Button Behavior:**
   - Short press in SECTION_ACK_ALARMS: cycle alarms
   - Short press in SECTION_ALARM_ACK: acknowledge alarm
   - Long press (3s): enter/exit system status mode

### Files Modified:
- src/TemperatureController.cpp
- include/TemperatureController.h

### Commits Made:
1. "fix: restore alarm activation by uncommenting updateAlarms logic"
2. "fix: alarm counter showing double count - fixed duplicate alarm detection"
3. "feat: simplify network display - remove verbose headers"
4. "feat: implement screen timeout and configurable alarm display"
5. "fix: acknowledged alarms cycling on button press"

### Build Status: Successfully compiled

### Next Steps: User testing on real hardware
