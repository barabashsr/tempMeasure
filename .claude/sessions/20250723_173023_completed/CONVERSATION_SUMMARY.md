# Conversation Summary: Relay Control Implementation and Hysteresis Fixes

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-07-21
- **Primary Task**: Implement "Relay Control Based on Alarm Priority and State" roadmap keystone
- **Secondary Task**: Fix hysteresis logic bugs in alarm system
- **Status**: Successfully completed with all features implemented and bugs fixed

## Initial Requirements

### User's Request
Implement relay control system with the following specifications:
1. **Relay 1 (Siren)**: Active only for critical alarms
2. **Relay 2 (Beacon)**: Complex behavior based on alarm priority and acknowledgment state
3. **Relay 3 (Spare)**: Modbus-only control, no automatic alarm behavior
4. **Modbus Control**: Override capability via registers 860-862 with AUTO/FORCE_OFF/FORCE_ON modes
5. **Status Feedback**: Move relay status from registers 863-865 to registers 11-13
6. **Documentation**: Update README.md, MODBUS_REGISTER_MAP.md, and USER_MANUAL_RU.md

### User's Clarifications
1. Relay3 hardware port: Marked as "needs to clarify" with placeholder in code
2. Relays should follow alarm states in AUTO mode
3. Relay3 default state: OFF
4. Relay control modes persist until toggled back to AUTO
5. Status register format: bit 0 = commanded state, bit 1 = actual state

## Implementation Details

### 1. Relay Control System Architecture

#### RelayControlMode Enum (RegisterMap.h)
```cpp
enum class RelayControlMode : uint16_t {
    AUTO = 0,        ///< Automatic control based on alarm states
    FORCE_OFF = 1,   ///< Force relay off regardless of alarms
    FORCE_ON = 2     ///< Force relay on regardless of alarms
};
```

#### Key Methods Added to TemperatureController
- `setRelayControlMode(relayNumber, mode)`
- `getRelayControlMode(relayNumber)`
- `getRelayCommandedState(relayNumber)`
- `getRelayActualState(relayNumber)`
- `forceRelayState(relayNumber, state)`

### 2. Relay Priority Logic Implementation

The `handleAlarmOutputs()` method was modified to implement complex relay control:

#### Relay 1 (Siren) Logic
- AUTO mode: Active only when CRITICAL alarms exist
- FORCE_OFF: Always off
- FORCE_ON: Always on

#### Relay 2 (Beacon) Logic
- AUTO mode:
  - CRITICAL alarms: Always active
  - HIGH priority: Active only if unacknowledged
  - MEDIUM priority: Active only if unacknowledged
  - LOW priority: Never active
- FORCE_OFF/FORCE_ON: Override as specified

#### Relay 3 (Spare) Logic
- AUTO mode: Always off (no alarm behavior)
- FORCE_OFF: Always off
- FORCE_ON: Always on
- Hardware port marked with TODO for future clarification

### 3. Modbus Integration

#### Register Mapping
- Registers 860-862: Relay control modes (R/W)
- Registers 11-13: Relay status feedback (R)
- Status format: `(actualState << 1) | commandedState`

#### TempModbusServer Modifications
- Added TemperatureController reference for relay control
- Constructor signature updated to accept controller
- Added relay control handling in `afterWriteRegister()`

### 4. Compilation Error Fix

**Problem**: `controllerPtr` not declared in TempModbusServer scope

**Solution**: 
1. Added `TemperatureController* controllerPtr` member to TempModbusServer
2. Updated constructor to accept and store controller reference
3. Modified main.cpp to pass controller when creating modbusServer

## Hysteresis Bug Fixes

### First Hysteresis Issue
**Problem**: Alarms firing at wrong temperature (29°C instead of 34°C) and oscillating

**Root Cause**: Incorrect hysteresis logic in `_checkCondition()`

**Fix**: Implemented proper hysteresis behavior:
- HIGH_TEMP alarms: Fire at threshold, clear at (threshold - hysteresis)
- LOW_TEMP alarms: Fire at threshold, clear at (threshold + hysteresis)

### Second Hysteresis Issue
**Problem**: Alarm not clearing when temperature drops below hysteresis threshold

**Root Cause**: CLEARED stage not included in hysteresis condition checks

**Fix**: Added CLEARED stage to the condition checking:
```cpp
if (_stage == AlarmStage::ACTIVE || _stage == AlarmStage::ACKNOWLEDGED || _stage == AlarmStage::CLEARED) {
    // Apply hysteresis logic
}
```

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added relay control features description
- Listed Modbus control capabilities
- Documented AUTO/FORCE_OFF/FORCE_ON modes

### MODBUS_REGISTER_MAP.md
- Added registers 11-13 for relay status
- Added registers 860-862 for relay control
- Documented bit format for status registers

### USER_MANUAL_RU.md
- Added Russian documentation for relay control
- Explained relay priority behavior
- Documented Modbus control options

## Commits Made
1. `feat(relay): implement relay control based on alarm priority and state`
2. `fix(modbus): add controller reference to TempModbusServer for relay control`
3. `docs: update README and Modbus register map with relay control features`
4. `docs: update Russian user manual with relay control documentation`
5. `fix(alarm): correct hysteresis logic for temperature alarms`
6. `fix(alarm): add CLEARED stage to hysteresis condition checks`

## Outstanding Items
1. **Unit Tests**: Need to add tests for relay priority control (marked as medium priority)
2. **Relay3 Hardware Port**: Awaiting clarification from user on PCF8575 port assignment

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Used bit-packed format for relay status registers to efficiently convey both commanded and actual states
2. Implemented relay control as part of TemperatureController to maintain centralized control logic
3. Added comprehensive logging for all relay state changes and alarm transitions
4. Maintained backward compatibility by keeping original relay behavior in AUTO mode

## Key Learning Points
1. Hysteresis must be applied during all alarm stages (ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, and CLEARED)
2. Relay control requires careful coordination between Modbus commands and automatic alarm behavior
3. Status feedback is critical for monitoring relay behavior in industrial systems
4. Documentation in multiple languages (English/Russian) is essential for international deployment
