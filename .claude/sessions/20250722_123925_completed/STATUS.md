## Session: 2025-07-21 08:15 - Continued from previous session
### Task: Implement alarm control via Modbus RTU
### Status: In Progress

### Investigation Results:
- Found alarm control requirements in /docs/main_requirements.md
- Reviewed detailed register map in /docs/MODBUS_REGISTER_MAP.md
- Corrected register organization understanding (XYY format: X=section, YY=point)
- Designed bit allocation with separate enable flags and priority values

### Implementation Progress:
#### Completed:
1. Extended RegisterMap.h with:
   - New register constants for sections 800-899
   - Private member variables for alarm config, relay control, hysteresis
   - Public methods for alarm/relay control
   - Bit masks for alarm configuration

2. Updated RegisterMap.cpp with:
   - Extended validation for new register ranges
   - Read/write handlers for registers 800-899
   - Implementation of new methods (getAlarmConfig, relay control)
   - Command register handling

3. Added processCommands() to TempModbusServer:
   - Checks for pending commands
   - Logs alarm configuration details
   - Clears pending command flag

4. Updated main.cpp:
   - Added processCommands() call in main loop

### Update: 08:45
- Completed: Extended RegisterMap for alarm control registers (800-899)
- Completed: Added alarm configuration bit fields and methods
- Completed: Implemented processCommands() method in TempModbusServer
- Completed: Added processCommands() call to main loop
- Modified: RegisterMap.h, RegisterMap.cpp, TempModbusServer.h, TempModbusServer.cpp, main.cpp
- Build Status: Successfully compiled with only deprecation warnings
- Next: Connect TemperatureController to process Modbus alarm configuration commands

### Alarm Configuration Register Format (8XX):
- Bit 0: Low Temperature Alarm Enable
- Bit 1: High Temperature Alarm Enable  
- Bit 2: Sensor Error Alarm Enable
- Bits 3-4: Low Temperature Priority
- Bits 5-6: High Temperature Priority
- Bits 7-8: Sensor Error Priority
- Bits 9-15: Reserved

### TODO:
- Add TemperatureController reference to TempModbusServer
- Implement actual alarm configuration updates in processCommands()
- Handle relay control based on register values
- Test with Modbus client simulator

### Update: 09:15
- Completed: Updated documentation files
- Modified: docs/MODBUS_REGISTER_MAP.md - Corrected alarm configuration bit definitions
- Modified: README.md - Added alarm control registers section (800-899)
- Modified: docs/USER_MANUAL_RU.md - Added Modbus alarm configuration and web interface updates
- Documentation now reflects:
  - Separate enable bits and priority values for alarms
  - Relay control registers
  - Command execution register
  - Web interface alarm enable/disable checkboxes
  - Examples in Python for Modbus configuration

### Update: 11:45:00
- Completed: Archived previous session
- Completed: Started new session for global planning
- Completed: Analyzed project requirements from docs/briefs
- Completed: Reviewed completed work from archived sessions
- Completed: Created GLOBAL_ROADMAP.md with comprehensive project plan
- Modified: Created docs/plans/GLOBAL_ROADMAP.md
- User refined the roadmap with specific clarifications
- Next: Follow roadmap phases for systematic implementation

### Global Roadmap Summary:
Created comprehensive roadmap with 5 priority areas:
1. Relay Control Logic - alarm priority based control and Modbus integration
2. Display & LED Improvements - scrolling, alarm cycling, system status mode, LED logic
3. Core Functionality - re-activation delays, sensor disconnection behavior, state transitions
4. Web Interface Features - trend charts, dashboard updates, Russian translation
5. Modbus RTU Completion - explicit triggers, safety validations

Current status: Foundation complete, ready to implement priority features

## New Session: 2025-07-21 11:36 - Implementing Relay Control Keystone
### Task: Relay Control Based on Alarm Priority and State
### Status: Completed

### Update: 12:00:00
- Completed: Implemented relay control system with Modbus override
- Added RelayControlMode enum (AUTO/FORCE_OFF/FORCE_ON)
- Modified TemperatureController with relay control methods
- Updated handleAlarmOutputs() to respect Modbus modes
- Added relay status registers 11-13
- Modified TempModbusServer to handle relay writes
- Fixed compilation errors by adding controller reference
- Updated all three documentation files
- Next: Fix hysteresis bug

### Update: 13:00:00
- Completed: Fixed hysteresis logic bug in Alarm.cpp
- Corrected HIGH_TEMPERATURE alarm: activate at threshold, clear at (threshold - hysteresis)
- Corrected LOW_TEMPERATURE alarm: activate at threshold, clear at (threshold + hysteresis)
- Successfully compiled and committed changes
- Documentation regenerated automatically via git hook

### Summary of Implementation:
1. **Relay Control System:**
   - RelayControlMode enum for AUTO/FORCE_OFF/FORCE_ON
   - Relay 1: Siren for critical alarms only
   - Relay 2: Beacon with complex priority logic
   - Relay 3: Modbus-only control (spare)
   - Modbus registers 860-862 for control
   - Status feedback in registers 11-13

2. **Hysteresis Fix:**
   - Fixed alarm oscillation at threshold values
   - Proper hysteresis implementation for both alarm types

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - README.md: Added relay control section
   - MODBUS_REGISTER_MAP.md: New registers documented
   - USER_MANUAL_RU.md: Russian documentation added

### Pending Tasks:
- Add unit tests for relay priority control
- Clarify Relay3 hardware port assignment

## New Session: 2025-07-21 19:45 - LED and Relay Fixes
### Task: Fix LED Logic and Relay1 Behavior
### Status: Completed

### Update: 20:30:00
- Completed: Fixed LED logic according to requirements
- Fixed GREEN LED to turn ON when no alarms (system OK)
- Fixed YELLOW LED to be solid for HIGH priority (was incorrectly blinking)
- Fixed BLUE LED to blink for LOW priority only
- Implemented smart blinking state management to prevent restart cycles
- Modified handleAlarmOutputs() in TemperatureController.cpp

### Update: 21:00:00
- Completed: Fixed relay1 behavior to activate on ANY active alarm
- Previously relay1 only activated on CRITICAL alarms
- Now relay1 (siren) activates for ANY priority active alarm (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Relay1 turns off only when ALL active alarms are acknowledged
- Fixed issue where handleAlarmOutputs() was overriding getRelayCommandedState()
- Committed fix with message: "fix(relay): restore relay1 behavior to activate on ANY active alarm"

### Key Changes:
1. **LED Logic Fixed:**
   - GREEN: ON when no alarms (system healthy)
   - RED: Solid for CRITICAL
   - YELLOW: Solid for HIGH (no blinking)
   - BLUE: Solid for MEDIUM, Blinking for LOW

2. **Relay1 Fixed:**
   - Changed from: `bool relay1State = false;` (then only set true for critical)
   - To: `bool relay1State = (criticalActive + highActive + mediumActive + lowActive) > 0;`
   - Now properly indicates ANY new active alarm to operators
